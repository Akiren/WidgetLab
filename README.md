=========

An javascript experiment using an elegant architecture for building modern web applications. This is what's possible when you don't rely on heavy javascript frameworks.

I used webstorm to build this and you can use it to easily get my project up and running right away. Either way, WebServer.js is a super simple Node server that you can use to load up index.html.

Enjoy!
